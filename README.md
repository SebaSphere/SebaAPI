# SebaAPI
Hey hey! This mod is meant to be a API meant for me to speed up mod development.

This mod aims to be a collection of various easy to use tools to make my life easier.

I "may" update this README.md with actual documentation later. Until then, if you're someone not me and you want to use this libary, you're a massive nerd.
